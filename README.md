# Diet-weight-analyze-and-prediction
This dataset is from kaggle and includes information from 100 participants, focusing on demographics, dietary habits, physical activity levels, and lifestyle factors to predict weight change over time. Key features comprise age, gender, current weight, daily caloric intake, macronutrient breakdown, sleep quality, and stress levels. The dataset aims to analyze how these variables interact and influence weight fluctuations, serving as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in nutrition and health. The analyses include descriptive, inferential, and predictive analyses using neural network.
